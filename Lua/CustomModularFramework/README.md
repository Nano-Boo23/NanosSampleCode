# What's this project?
A generic modular framework I built from scratch after having the need to implement this kind of structure for a personal Lua project (a game I'm making on Roblox called 'HEARTBEAT'). <br>
To be more specific, I needed a way of easily communicating between all scripts.

### File extension notes:
`.lua` -> Module script <br>
`.client.lua` -> Local script <br>
`.server.lua` -> Server script <br>
