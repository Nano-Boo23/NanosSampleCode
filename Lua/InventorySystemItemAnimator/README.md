# What's this project?
A complementation to a fully custom Roblox inventory system that renders dropped items as a spinning version of their model, similar to Minecraft. <br>
Custom made for [Echoes of Arcania](https://www.roblox.com/games/94335825089405/Echoes-of-Arcania) <br>
The inventory system that this code is used for was also made by me, and I would totally showcase it too, but it would reveal the inside workings of the server, which I want to prevent to avoid smarter exploiters to take advantage of it. <br>

I can however, include a video of an early-ish version of the inventory system in action. <br>
