# Nano_Boo's general scripting portfolio

Hiya! Welcome to my Github repository that I use as a scripting portfolio. Do note that it is still unfinished. <br>

## About this portfolio and me
I use this repo alongside a more updated and specific portfolio for each application I take to showcase my skills as a scripter. <br>

I understand that working in projects with a large team requires good communication, which also englobes the fact that scripts HAVE to be readable, reusable, and intuitive for other scripters to edit. So in these situations, my main focus naturally is to stay as communicative as I possibly can with the team.

# Introduction
This portfolio serves as a collection of selective work that I have decided to showcase, including the source code of partial or full programs / systems alongside a README file for each project, detailing my work, gving context on why and what it was made for, and including images and videos. <br>
The code was taken directly from the scripts with no special editing, including my original comments. So what you see here is how you can expect my work to look like; script organization, comments, variable naming, type checking, etc.
