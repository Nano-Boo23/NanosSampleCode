# Nano_Boo's general scripting portfolio

Hiya! Welcome to my Github repository that I use as a scripting portfolio. Do note that it is still unfinished. <br>

## About this portfolio and me
I use this repo alongside a more updated and specific portfolio for each application I take to showcase my skills as a scripter. <br>

I understand that working in projects with a large team requires especially good communication, and so my main focus as I work in a team is to always make my scripts readable, reusable, and intuitive for other scripters to edit. <br>
I Also am very communicative, send daily progress reports, accept feedback, quickly learn from my mistakes and strive to be a better scripter than I was yesterday.

# Introduction
This portfolio serves as a collection of selective work that I have decided to showcase, including the source code of partial or full programs / systems alongside a README file for each project, detailing my work, giving context on why and what it was made for, and usually **including images or videos**. <br>

The code was taken directly from the scripts with no special editing, also including my original comments. So what you see here is how you can expect my work to look like; script organization, comments, variable naming, type checking, etc.
